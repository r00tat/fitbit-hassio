# Fitbit App for Home Assistant

This Fitbit App for Fitbit OS version 4 (Versa 2) allows you to call scripts on your home assistant. You can configure the address, the bearer token and the scripts you'd like to call.

This app is not affiliated with the [home assistant project](https://www.home-assistant.io/) itself, it's just built to be used with home assistant.

It is not perfect, as I had my troubles with the styling on fitbit and the documentation, but it does what it should.

## Development

For local development the Fitbit Simulator is quite usefull. Start it before trying to install your app and it should connect automatically.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
build-and-install
```
